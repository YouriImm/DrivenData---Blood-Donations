## About

Included in this repository is a data science competition that I participated in in May 2018. The competition is still being hosted on [DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/2/warm-up-predict-blood-donations/ "Driven Data"), a data science competition platform. As intended by DrivenData, I used this competition as first steps towards practicing machine learning algorithms.

In this repository, you will find my final submission using logistic regression. Other models like support vector machines were consistently outperformed by logistic regression for this specific challenge.
